# Chapter 1: Getting Started With Pandas
<br>
<br>

**Pandas** is an open-source Python library used primarily for **data manipulation and analysis**. It's built on top of NumPy and provides flexible and powerful data structures designed to make working with **structured data (like tables and time series)** fast and easy.
<br>

#### What Pandas Does:
- Reads and writes data from various file formats: CSV, Excel, SQL databases, JSON, etc.
- Handles missing data gracefully and provides tools to clean it.
- Filters, sorts, and reshapes data efficiently.
- Aggregates and summarizes data using group operations.
- Performs time series analysis, such as date range generation and resampling.
- Supports label-based indexing, which makes working with rows and columns intuitive.

Pandas is widely used in data science, finance, machine learning, and any area where structured data is analyzed. It essentially turns raw data into a format that's much easier to analyze and visualize.
