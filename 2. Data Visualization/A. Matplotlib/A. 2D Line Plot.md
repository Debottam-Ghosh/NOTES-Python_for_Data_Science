# Chapter 1: 2D Line Plot in Matplotlib

<br>
<br>

## What is a Line Plot?
A 2D Line Plot in Matplotlib is used to **visualize data points connected by straight lines**. It is often used to show trends, time series, or relationships between variables.

<br>

## Basic Line Plot (without any style):
```bash
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

x = [1, 2, 3, 4]
y = [2, 5, 7, 10]

plt.plot(x, y)
plt.show()
```
